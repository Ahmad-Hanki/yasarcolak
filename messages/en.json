    "h2d2": "On the day of the procedure, a consent form is signed in the endoscopy unit, the patient is registered and the patient is taken to the preparation room. In the preparation room, the patient is hospitalized and prepared for the procedure. The relevant nurse asks the patient whether he/she has a chronic disease, the medications he/she is taking, the last time he/she took which medication, the last time he/she ate and drank, and whether he/she has any allergies. The patient is then given anesthesia and taken to the procedure room with the patient bed.    ",
    "h2d3": "An endoscopy nurse, anesthesia team and gastroenterologist are present in the procedure room. Before the procedure begins, there is a preparation period of about 1-2 minutes. During this time, the patient’s blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oxygen level in the blood are measured with a small device like a clothespin attached to the fingertip. A plastic nasal mask is inserted into the nostrils to ensure continuous oxygen intake during the procedure. Before the procedure, a spray is sprayed into the mouth and throat to numb the throat. This spray numbs the tongue, mouth and throat and makes the procedure easier to perform. Then a disposable plastic mouthpiece with a hole in the center is placed in the patient’s mouth between the front teeth through which the endoscopy tool will pass. Finally, the anesthesia team administers intravenous medication and the patient falls asleep after about 10 to 20 seconds.    ",
    "h2d4": "Once the anesthesia takes effect, the procedure begins. Gastroscopy is a procedure that takes about 5 minutes. During this procedure, the patient’s throat, esophagus, stomach and approximately the first 20-30 cm of the small intestine are examined. After the procedure is over, the endoscopy tool, nose mask and mouthpiece are removed. The patient is again taken to the rest room with his/her bed. Within a few minutes, the effect of the anesthesia drugs wears off and the patient begins to wake up. After about 15-20 minutes of rest in the resting room, the patient is expected to fully wake up and the intravenous line is removed and the patient is discharged when he/she feels well.    ",

    "h3": "After Gastroscopy Procedure    ",
    "h3d1": "After the gastroscopy, the effect of the anesthesia drugs wears off and the patient begins to recover. Pulse rate, blood oxygen level and blood pressure are checked. The patient is then informed about the procedure and discharged.    ",
    "h3d2": "The difficulty in swallowing caused by the effect of the spray sprayed to numb the throat before the procedure lasts for about 30-60 minutes after gastroscopy. For this reason, liquid and food consumption is started one hour after the procedure. In routine endoscopic procedures, a biopsy sample is taken from the stomach. For this reason, it is recommended to prefer light and soft foods and not to consume very hot foods and drinks on the first day after the procedure. In cases that may be more risky in terms of bleeding, such as removal of polyps or masses during the procedure, the liquid diet may be extended for a few more days. If there are any medications (especially blood thinners) that have been suspended due to gastroscopy, the patient will be informed about when they will be resumed.    ",
    "h3d3": "It is important not to drive for a few hours after the procedure due to anesthesia and not to do things that require attention. At the end of these few hours, the patient can return to his/her daily work on the same day.    ",

    "h4": "Risks Of Gastroscopy    ",
    "h4d1": "Gastroscopy is a very easy and comfortable procedure. Routine endoscopic procedures are very safe and the risk is very low, especially when performed by competent hands.    ",
    "h4d2": "Especially in cases where endoscopic intervention is required (such as polyp or mass removal, stent placement, expansion procedures), risks such as bleeding may rarely be encountered. Such unwanted events (complications) can be easily managed in procedures performed by competent people.    ",

    "h5": "Frequently Asked Questions About Gastroscopy    ",

    "h5c1": "Is it an Important Procedure for Early Diagnosis?",
    "h5d1": "Gastroscopy can be life-saving by providing early diagnosis and, in some cases, treatment. To give an example of this, both gastroscopy and colonoscopy screening are performed in people with anemia or iron deficiency or positive fecal occult blood test in the tests performed when the patient has no complaints yet. In these scans, early stage tumors and cancers are detected in a considerable number of people and can be treated endoscopically.    ",

    "h5c2": "In which cases is it applied?",
    "h5d21": "Gastroscopy is frequently performed for complaints such as pain, burning, souring, scraping sensation in the stomach, bad breath, bloating, indigestion, loss of appetite, burning in the chest, bitter water in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, feeling of food stuck in the throat or chest, anemia, vitamin deficiencies, nausea, vomiting, hoarseness. It is also performed for complaints such as blood coming from the mouth (it may be red or in the form of coffee grounds), blood coming from the rectum or black colored stools (it should be noted that black colored stools may be a sign of stomach bleeding), involuntary weight loss.    ",
    "h5d22": "In people with a family history of stomach cancer, gastroscopy should be performed for control purposes regardless of the complaint, and if a bacterium called helicobacter pylori is detected in the stomach, it should be treated appropriately.    ",

    "h5c3": "Who Cannot Have Gastroscopy?",
    "h5d3": "Gastroscopy should not be performed on people who have consumed liquid or solid food or drunk water in the last 8 hours. The incomplete emptying of the stomach poses a risk as it may cause stomach contents to escape into the throat and lungs during the procedure. Therefore, food and beverage consumption should be stopped at least 8 hours before the procedure. In addition, since the use of certain blood thinners may increase the risk of bleeding, gastroscopy should be planned with the knowledge of the relevant doctor. In addition, due to the risk of anesthesia in patients with serious heart and lung diseases, kidney and liver failure and in elderly patients, the procedure should be decided by the doctor and anesthesiologist together. Routine gastroscopic procedures should be avoided in pregnant women unless absolutely necessary.    ",

    "h5c4": "Is there any pain or gagging during the gastroscopy procedure?",
    "h5d4": "Since the procedure is performed under anesthesia, the patient does not feel any pain or gagging during the procedure. The patient does not even remember the procedure after the anesthesia wears off.    ",

    "h5c5": "Can People With Chronic Diseases Such As Heart, Cancer And Diabetes Have Gastroscopy?",
    "h5d5": "People with chronic diseases can also undergo gastroscopy; however, the medications used for anesthesia preparation must be checked by a doctor. In some cases, medication changes or dose changes may be required. For this reason, the person should discuss this situation with his/her doctor before the procedure.    ",

    "h5c6": "At what intervals can gastroscopy be performed?",
    "h5d6": "There is no routine time for repeat gastroscopy. Each patient and disease has a specific follow-up period. For example, gastritis or duodenal ulcers usually do not require a routine follow-up endoscopy, but gastric ulcers may require a follow-up gastroscopy after treatment (1-2 months). This is because of the rare risk of stomach cancers starting as stomach ulcers.    ",

    "h5c7": "Is Gastroscopy a Painful Procedure?",
    "h5d7": "Anesthesia is given during the procedure and there are no complaints such as pain, nausea, gagging or inability to breathe.    ",

    "h5c8": "Is a Patient Relative, Companion Required for the Procedure?",
    "h5d8": "It is not necessary to have a companion with the person undergoing the procedure; however, since anesthesia is given, no work requiring attention and no driving should be done for a few hours after the procedure. For this reason, it is recommended that the patient does not drive himself/herself to the procedure.",

    "h5c9": "When Can I Eat After Gastroscopy?",
    "h5d9": "If no intervention was performed during the procedure, food can usually be consumed one hour after the procedure. Biopsies are often taken during the gastroscopy procedure. Therefore, on the first day after the procedure, it is recommended to consume liquid foods such as soups; yogurt, pudding and puree-like soft and low-fat foods. If an intervention is performed during the procedure, the doctor will inform the patient about what needs to be done.    ",

    "h5c10": "If a biopsy was taken during the procedure, when is the pathology result known?",
    "h5d10": "Pathology results are usually available within 7-10 days.    ",

    "h5c11": "Does Gastroscopy Prevent Breastfeeding?",
    "h5d11": "The procedure itself does not prevent breastfeeding; however, due to the risk of the anesthesia drugs administered for the procedure passing into the milk, it is recommended to express milk for about 4-6 hours after gastroscopy and discard it before giving it to the baby. To prevent the baby from starving, the mother can express and store breast milk before the procedure and give it to her baby during the hours when she cannot breastfeed.    "

    "h1d1":"A colonoscopy helps the gastroenterologist to detect problems in your colon. Colonoscopy should be performed in people with abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, change in defecation pattern (someone who regularly goes to the toilet once a day starts going to the toilet every 2-3 days or someone who goes to the toilet every 2 days starts going to the toilet 2-3 times a day), blood coming from the anus, slimy stools, unexplained weight loss, previous intestinal surgery, cancer or polyps.    ",
    "h1d2":"Colonoscopy and gastroscopy should be performed in people who have no complaints, except for a family history of colon cancer, iron deficiency, anemia (anemia) or occult blood in stool analysis.    ",

    "lih1":"Bowel disorders:",
    "lid1":" A colonoscopy can help your doctor discover possible causes of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, chronic diarrhea and other bowel problems.",
    "lih2":"Colon cancer screening:",
    "lid2":" If you are over 45 and have an average risk of colon cancer, your doctor may recommend a colonoscopy every 5 years. If you have other risk factors, your doctor may recommend an earlier screening. Colonoscopy is one of several options for colon cancer screening",
    "lih3":"Diagnosis of polyps: ",
    "lid3":" If you have had a previous treatment for polyps, your doctor may recommend a follow-up colonoscopy to look for and remove additional polyps. This is also done to reduce your risk of colon cancer.",
    "lih4":"During a course of treatment:",
    "lid4":"Sometimes a colonoscopy may also be performed for treatment purposes, such as placing a stent or removing an object in your colon.",

    "h1d4":"Colonoscopy is a procedure that can be performed not only for diagnosis but also for treatment. One of the most common conditions encountered during this procedure is colon polyps, especially in people over the age of 40. During colonoscopy, it is possible not only to diagnose but also to treat these polyps. If colon polyps are detected, they are removed with different techniques depending on their type or size. In this way, both diagnosis and treatment are provided and the risk of progression of these polyps and possible colon cancer in the future is eliminated.    ",
    "h1d5":"During colonoscopy, rectal diseases such as hemorrhoids and fissures can also be treated. In addition, procedures such as diagnosis of rectal bleeding, stopping bleeding by intervening in bleeding lesions, removal of superficial tumors or early stage cancers (endoscopic mucosal resection-EMR or endoscopic submucosal dissection-ESD), dilatation of strictures in the large intestine (dilatation procedures) or stenting are also performed.    ",

    "h2":"Who Is Suitable For Colonoscopy?    ",
    "h2d1":"Colonoscopy is a procedure that everyone over the age of 45 should have and repeat every 5 years, whether or not they have any complaints. The aim is to screen for colon cancer, as colon cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the world. With colonoscopy, polyps (moles) that are precursors of cancer can be easily recognized and removed during the procedure. Thus, cancers that may develop from polyps can also be prevented. As you can see, colon cancer is actually a preventable disease. Colonoscopy may be recommended at an earlier age, especially for people with a family history of colon cancer. For example, if one person in the family is diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of 45, it is recommended that other family members start colonoscopy screening 10 years earlier, at the age of 35.    ",
    "h2d2":"For colonoscopy, the intestine must first be cleansed. Colonoscopy cannot be performed without this cleaning. In addition, since it is a procedure that requires anesthesia, the procedure should be performed after evaluating the risk of anesthesia in heart, kidney and lung patients. In case of blood thinners, the procedure should be performed after the necessary precautions are taken in consultation with the doctor. The procedure is also not appropriate in case of suspected intestinal obstruction. Pregnant women should not undergo the procedure unless it is absolutely necessary.    ",

    "h3":"Risks Of Colonoscopy    ",
    "h3d1":"Routine colonoscopy is a very safe procedure when performed in experienced hands.    ",
    "h3d2":"Bleeding and bowel perforation are theoretically possible risks, especially in cases requiring advanced endoscopic procedures such as removal of large polyps and superficial tumors. However, in more than 35,000 endoscopic and colonoscopic procedures performed by Gastroenterology and Advanced Endoscopic Applications Specialist Prof. Dr. Yaşar Çolak, there has never been a case of intestinal perforation.    ",

    "h4":"How Is Colonoscopy Performed?    ",
    "h4d1":"Before the colonoscopy, the person must have done bowel cleansing the day before and must not have consumed any liquid or solid food in the last 8 hours.    ",

    "h5":"Preparation Phase    ",
    "h5d1":"The day before the procedure, the patient is asked to have a small toast with cheese and tea for breakfast and then to drink only clear liquids throughout the day. Clear liquid means liquids without sediment. The criterion here is that the liquid placed in the glass should be clear enough to show the other side. For example; water, tea, lemonade, grain-free meat broth, grain-free chicken broth, filtered compote juice without pulp, apple juice, cherry juice can be consumed easily. However, the consumption of cloudy and pulpy liquids such as soup, peach juice, apricot juice or milk is not suitable as it may cause intestinal pollution.    ",
    "h5d2":"Another important part of the preparation for colonoscopy is diarrhea and bowel cleansing with medication. The drugs used for this have changed considerably in recent years. Today, the preferred preparation is an orange-flavored powder that is mixed in a glass of water and drunk. This powder is mixed in a glass of water and drunk at 14.00 hours, one day before the procedure. Then wait for about half an hour and drink plenty of water or clear liquids (about 2 liters in 4 hours) from 14.30. After the second dose at 20.00 p.m., you should drink 2 liters of water or clear liquids again after 20.30. On the morning of the procedure at home, the preparation process ends with a final enema through the anus, waiting for 15-20 minutes and then going to the toilet.    ",

    "h6":"During Transaction    ",
    "h6d1":"On the day of the procedure, after registration in the endoscopy unit and signing the consent form, the patient is admitted to the procedure preparation room. Here, the relevant nurse asks questions such as whether the person has a chronic disease, the medications the person is taking, the last time he/she took which medication, the food and water he/she eats and drinks, and whether he/she has any allergies. Before the procedure, the person is dressed in a disposable shorts. Afterwards, an intravenous line is opened in the arm to administer anesthesia medication and the person is taken to the procedure room with his/her bed. There is an endoscopy nurse, anesthesia team and a doctor in the procedure room.    ",
    "h6d2":"There is a preparation process of about 1-2 minutes before the procedure. During this time, the person’s blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oxygen level in the blood are measured with a small device like a clothespin attached to the fingertip. A plastic nasal mask is inserted into the nostrils, through which oxygen is continuously supplied during the procedure. Finally, the anesthesia team administers intravenous medication and the person falls asleep after about 10-20 seconds. A rectal examination is performed before the procedure. The anus is evaluated for hemorrhoids or cracks. After applying gel to the anus, the procedure is started. The procedure is performed with a flexible device with a light and camera at the end. During the procedure, approximately the last 20-30 cm of the large intestine and small intestine are examined. The presence of conditions such as polyps, masses, inflammation and stenosis in the intestines is checked. If polyps are detected, they are removed with different techniques depending on their size. After the procedure is finished, the colonoscopy instrument is removed from the anus and the procedure is terminated. The person is then taken to the rest room with his/her bed. Within a few minutes, the person starts to wake up as the effect of anesthesia drugs wears off. The person is kept in the rest room for about 15-20 minutes. After the person fully wakes up, the intravenous line is removed and the person is discharged.    ",

    "h7":"Virtual Colonoscopy    ",
    "h7d1":"Virtual colonoscopy is an imaging procedure in which the large intestine is examined using CT (computed tomography) or MRI. The procedure is not a substitute for a standard colonoscopy.    ",
    "h7d2":"This procedure requires the same preparation as a routine colonoscopy. The images are then analyzed on a computer using a CT or MRI scanner. Although the procedure seems practical, it has some important disadvantages. The first of these is that lesions under 1 cm may be missed and mucosal surface changes cannot be evaluated clearly. Another important disadvantage is that if a suspicious lesion is seen during the procedure, a biopsy cannot be taken, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made and the lesion cannot be treated. If a suspicious lesion is detected, standard colonoscopy should be performed again with colonoscopy preparation and the lesion should be recognized, a biopsy should be taken or a lesion such as a polyp should be removed.    ",
    "h7d3":"As you can see, although this procedure may seem practical, it is not a substitute for standard colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy is an auxiliary imaging method used only in special cases where routine colonoscopy cannot be performed.    ",

    "h8":"Frequently Asked Questions About Colonoscopy    ",
    "q1":"What is Colon Polyp? What happens if a polyp is detected during the procedure?",
    "a1":"A polyp is a type of mole. Polyps in the large intestine are important because colon cancers are often caused by the growth of polyps. Colon polyps are divided into polyps with and without cancer risk. Which of the polyps is at risk of cancer can only be determined by examining the removed fragment under a microscope, i.e. by pathology. Therefore, polyps seen during colonoscopy are removed with different techniques during the procedure, depending on the size and shape of the polyp. This also prevents future colon cancers.    ",
    "q2":"How long does it take to get the pathology result if a polyp is removed?",
    "a2":"Polyp or endoscopic biopsies are usually completed within a week. ",
    "q3":"Can People With Chronic Diseases Such As Heart, Cancer And Diabetes Have Colonoscopy?",
    "a3":"Patients with such chronic diseases can also undergo a colonoscopic procedure. The important point here is that the patient’s medications should be regulated before the procedure, necessary precautions should be taken according to the disease and the patient should be carefully evaluated by both the gastroenterologist who will perform the procedure and the anesthesiologist.    ",
    "q4":"Is Anesthesia Applied in Colonoscopy?",
    "a4":"During the procedure, a short-term general anesthesia is applied by intravenous drug administration. Thus, the patient will not feel any pain and will not remember the procedure.    ",
    "q5":"Is Colonoscopy a Painful Procedure?",

    "q6":"What to Consider in Preparation for Colonoscopy?",
    "a6":"The most common mistakes made in preparation for colonoscopy are not taking medications on time, not drinking enough water and consuming fluids with pulp. In order to ensure adequate bowel cleansing, water consumption should be high and fluids with pulp (such as tomato soup, lentil soup, apricot juice) that may cause fecal formation should not be consumed.",
    "q7":"Does Nausea Occur During Preparation for Colonoscopy, What Should I Do Against Nausea?",
    "a7":"With today’s preparation medications, nausea is no longer a common complaint. In case of nausea during preparation, fluid intake should be suspended for a while, but once the nausea subsides, the preparation should be resumed.    ",
    "q8":"Is it possible to experience rectal irritation during preparation for colonoscopy? What should be done to prevent this?",
    "a8":"Colonoscopy performed in competent hands does not cause irritation of the rectum. Before the procedure, the anus is examined and a lubricating gel is applied to the anus before the procedure. This gel minimizes irritation.    ",
    "q9":"What Should I Pay Attention to After Colonoscopy?",
    "a9":"After the routine colonoscopy procedure, the anesthesia drugs are allowed to wear off for about half an hour and then the patient is discharged after feeling well. It is requested not to drive or do anything that requires attention for a few hours after the procedure. Normal food intake can be started approximately 1 hour after the procedure. The person can return to daily work a few hours after the procedure.    ",
    "q10":"Does the Patient Have Gas Problems After Colonoscopy?",
    "a10":"The intestines are normally contracted and stuck together. During a colonoscopy, a small amount of air is introduced into the intestine so that the inside of the intestine can be evaluated. This opens the folds of this organ and allows diseases that may be present between the folds to be recognized without being missed. However, sometimes this air given during the procedure may cause gas and abdominal pain. At the end of the procedure, the patient does not experience such pains thanks to the withdrawal of this air. However, if there is a complaint of gas, the patient should walk slowly after the effect of the anesthesia drugs wears off, which will facilitate the removal of the gas from the body.    ",
    "q11":"Is There a Bleeding Problem After Colonoscopy? What Should Be Considered In This Case?",
    "a11":"No bleeding is expected after routine colonoscopy. However, bleeding may occur in rare cases such as removal of polyps or superficial tumors or biopsy. If there is minor bleeding, the patient is informed about this. If there is any other bleeding, this should be reported to the doctor immediately.    ",
    "q12":"Is Colonoscopy an Obstacle to Breastfeeding?",
    "a12":"Since anesthesia will be taken, it is recommended to express and discard breast milk for 4-6 hours after the procedure.    ",
    "q13":"In which cases should a doctor be consulted after colonoscopy?",
    "a13":"There may be some abdominal pain due to gas after the procedure. However, in cases such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, feeling of weakness, darkening in the eyes, feeling faint or blood coming from the rectum, you should definitely consult a doctor.    "

      "q2":"Is the procedure reversible?",
      "a2":"Within a few months after the procedure, the stomach can be restored by cutting the stitches in the stomach. However, even if the stitches are cut after this period, the stomach cannot return to its former state as the stitched parts will be stuck to each other. This is actually an advantage in terms of the permanence of the procedure.      ",

      "q3":"What happens to the sewn parts?",
      "a3":"The tissues in the stomach that have been shrunk by suturing fuse over time and remain in the stomach as shrunken but living tissue. Thanks to the tissues sticking to each other, the stomach does not open and thus its volume does not expand. The sutured parts remain in the stomach and no part of the stomach is cut out. The fact that no part of the stomach is removed ensures that the stomach continues to make enough acid, unlike in surgeries, and prevents digestive complaints. There is also no iron and vitamin deficiency.      ",

      "q4":"Who can undergo endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty?",
      "a4":"The procedure is performed on people with a body mass index (BMI) or body mass index ratio (body weight divided by the square of height) above 30. For example, a person who weighs 90 kg and is 1.68 meters tall has a BMI of 90/1.68 X 1.68 (90/2.82) 31.9. In addition to the fact that this index must be 30 and above for the procedure to be applied, another important point is that the person should not be able to lose weight despite at least 6 months of diet attempts and adequate physical activity. In summary, this procedure can be performed in people who are obese and cannot lose weight naturally.      ",

      "q5":"Can this procedure be performed in people who have had stomach reduction surgery before and gained weight again?",
      "a5":"Yes, it can be done; however, in order to give a clear answer to this question, it would be healthier to evaluate the final state of the stomach with endoscopy and make a decision accordingly.      ",

      "q6":"How long does the procedure take?",
      "a6":"Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty takes approximately 1.5-2 hours.      ",

      "q7":"Do you need hospitalization?",
      "a7":"It is recommended to stay in the hospital for one night after the procedure for control purposes. Since the stomach shrinks after the procedure, there may be some stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. For this reason, stomach medication, nausea medication and serum are given after the procedure to ensure that the patient spends the night more comfortably. The patient is discharged the next day.      ",

      "q8":"How long after the procedure can you start eating and drinking?",

      "q9":"What kind of diet should be followed after the procedure?",
      "a9":"Before the procedure, the person is evaluated by a dietician and a specific diet is organized. Before the procedure, a detailed body analysis is performed to measure the person’s muscle mass, fat ratio, visceral fat and water ratio, and these values are closely monitored in the post-procedure period. Diet is also designed according to these values. In general, we recommend only liquid nutrition in the first week after the procedure, soft foods in the form of puree in the second week and then a gradual transition to normal foods.      ",

      "q10":"What are the differences of the procedure from stomach reduction surgeries?",
      "a101":"Stomach reduction surgeries are one of the effective treatment methods frequently performed in obesity treatment in recent years; however, like other surgeries, it carries some risks in itself. In endoscopic stomach reduction, unlike surgeries, no incision is made in the abdominal skin and the abdominal cavity is not entered.      ",
      "a102":"In addition, in surgeries, a part of the stomach is cut out and the remaining stomach parts are sewn together. In endoscopic stomach reduction, no part of the stomach is cut or removed. The stomach is reduced in size by suturing it endoscopically from the inside. In this way, risks such as intra-abdominal infection and gastric leakage due to surgery are minimized.      ",
      "a103":" In addition, iron and vitamin deficiencies may occur after stomach reduction and gastric bypass surgeries, and iron and vitamin supplements are usually required for life. However, since no part of the stomach is removed in the endoscopic stomach reduction procedure, iron and vitamin deficiencies are not seen and therefore no supplements are needed.      ",
      "a104":"  Stomach reduction surgeries usually require hospitalization for a few days and then a week of bed rest at home. In the endoscopic stomach reduction procedure, the patient stays in the hospital for only one night for control purposes and is discharged the next day. The patient is able to do all kinds of work within a day or two.      ",
      "a105":"  To summarize; the biggest advantages of endoscopic stomach reduction procedures are that the complications related to the surgery, i.e. unwanted side effects, are very low and the recovery time is much faster.      ",

      "a11":"Both international studies and the most valuable scientific publications called “meta-analysis”, in which the data of many international studies are combined and analyzed, have proven that this procedure is a reliable and effective method. Based on this evidence, the method was approved by the FDA (American Food and Drug Administration) in 2022.      ",

      "q12":"How much weight is lost after the procedure?",
      "a12":"The expected weight loss in one year after the procedure is approximately 20-30 percent. This rate is closely related to the person’s compliance with diet and physical activity.      "

For this reason, the volume of the balloon is adjusted according to the stomach volume of each individual during endoscopic application. This volume and the required amount are decided during the endoscopic procedure. Leaving the balloon volume at 400 ml in an individual who needs a 600 ml balloon will result in failure of the procedure. The most important advantage of the endoscopic gastric balloon application compared to the swallowable balloons that have been used in recent years is the possibility of adjusting the size of the gastric balloon according to the stomach volume of each individual.

In addition, the procedure should not be performed if formations such as tumors and ulcers are seen in the stomach during the endoscopic control to be performed before the procedure. If treatable conditions such as gastritis or ulcers are detected in the endoscopic control, these problems should be treated first and then the procedure should be performed.    ",
    
    "h4":"Gastric Balloon Application    ",

    "h5":"Preparation Process    ",
    "h5d1":"Endoscopic control is recommended about a week before the gastric balloon procedure. This is primarily to make sure that there is no disease (such as ulcer and tumor) that will prevent the balloon procedure. In addition, if a correctable health problem such as gastritis and ulcer is detected, it is aimed to treat these problems in the period until the procedure. If there is no obstacle in the endoscopic examination, the day of the procedure is planned. An 8-hour fasting is sufficient before the procedure. Both solid food and liquids including water should be stopped 8 hours before the procedure and the stomach should be empty.    ",
    "h6":"How Is The Process Done?    ",
    "h6d1":"The procedure is performed in a hospital setting and in the endoscopy unit. People are prepared by the endoscopy nurse before the procedure. During this preparation, the patient’s diseases, any allergies and current medications are questioned. After the file is filled out and the signature of the person is obtained for consent for the procedure, an intravenous line is opened to administer anesthesia drugs. Then he/she is taken to the procedure room. In the meantime, the patient is monitored; as in all endoscopic procedures, blood pressure, oxygen level in the blood and heart rhythm are continuously monitored on monitors. The stomach is entered with the endoscopy device and the inside of the stomach is checked for the last time. The gastric balloon is then inserted. Afterwards, the gastric balloon is inflated to an average of 500-600 cc in accordance with the stomach volume and the procedure is terminated.    ",
    "h7":"How Long Does The Process Take?    ",
    "h7d1":"The duration of the procedure is approximately 15 minutes. After the procedure, the person is taken to the rest room where he/she is discharged after resting for about 15-20 minutes and after the effect of anesthesia drugs wears off.    ",
    "h8":"After Gastric Balloon Placement    ",
    "h8d1":"Although hospitalization is not required after gastric balloon procedure, it is recommended that the patient stays in the hospital for one night. This hospitalization is to ensure a more comfortable night after the procedure; because the person does not feel any complaints in the first hours after the balloon application; however, nausea, vomiting and non-severe cramp-like pain may start about 6 hours after the procedure. Although the severity of these complaints gradually decreases after the first day, they usually last up to 3 days. Especially in the evening and night of the balloon procedure, nausea and cramps are at their peak. Spending this period in the hospital and intravenous administration of serum, cramps and nausea medication makes the process more comfortable. Within a few days, the complaints gradually decrease and disappear day by day.    ",

    "a1":"As with all endoscopic procedures, the procedure is performed under anesthesia. In this way, the patient does not feel any pain or ache during the very short procedure and does not remember the procedure.    ",

    "q2":"What are the Risks and Side Effects?    ",
    "a2":"The gastric balloon procedure, performed by experienced hands, is an extremely safe procedure and has no serious side effects. The most common side effects that may be related to the procedure are nausea, vomiting and cramps that start after the procedure and pass within a few days.    ",

    "q3":"Does a Gastric Balloon Burst?    ",
    "a3":"Contrary to popular belief, the risk of gastric balloon bursting is quite rare.    ",

    "q4":"How long does the gastric balloon stay in the stomach?    ",
    "a4":"There are gastric balloons that can stay in the stomach for 6 months and 12 months. We generally prefer 6-month gastric balloons. Staying in for more than 6 months has a low effect on weight loss. For this reason, we recommend removing the balloon at the end of 6 months.    ",

    "q5":"How to Remove a Gastric Balloon?",
    "a5":"The gastric balloon is removed in a 10-minute endoscopic procedure under anesthesia. The procedure is quite easy. The patient rests in a rest room until the anesthetic wears off (about 15-20 minutes) and is discharged after the anesthetic medication wears off. There is no need to stay in hospital for this procedure.    ",

    "q6":"When Does Weight Loss Start After the Procedure?    ",
    "a6":"The weight loss process starts immediately after the gastric balloon application and this process continues for about 6 months. ",

    "q7":"What Should Be Considered After the Procedure?    ",
    "a7":"A healthy lifestyle and diet are essential after all obesity procedures, including the gastric balloon procedure. Otherwise, it is very difficult to reach the desired weight. Therefore, it is very important to follow the diet recommended by the dietitian. In general, liquid nutrition is recommended for the first 5-7 days after gastric balloon application, soft and puree-style foods in the second week, and a gradual transition to normal foods in the 3rd week.
