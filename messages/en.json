    "description": "Looking into body cavities with a thin and flexible instrument with a light and a camera at the end is generally referred to as endoscopy. Endoscopic procedures are called by different names depending on the area examined. The most commonly used ones are gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Gastroscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) is the procedure in which the esophagus, stomach and the first parts of the small intestine (duodenum) are examined through the mouth. The procedure that examines the large intestine and the last parts of the small intestine is called colonoscopy.",

    "h2": "Gastroscopy Procedure",
    "h2d1": "In general, there is no need for intensive preparation before gastroscopy. At least 8 hours of fasting (no fluid and water consumption) is sufficient for the procedure to be performed. Only some blood thinners may need to be discontinued before the procedure.",

    "h2d2": "On the day of the procedure, a consent form is signed in the endoscopy unit, the patient is registered and the patient is taken to the preparation room. In the preparation room, the patient is hospitalized and prepared for the procedure. The relevant nurse asks the patient whether he/she has a chronic disease, the medications he/she is taking, the last time he/she took which medication, the last time he/she ate and drank, and whether he/she has any allergies. The patient is then given anesthesia and taken to the procedure room with the patient bed.    ",
    "h2d3": "An endoscopy nurse, anesthesia team and gastroenterologist are present in the procedure room. Before the procedure begins, there is a preparation period of about 1-2 minutes. During this time, the patient’s blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oxygen level in the blood are measured with a small device like a clothespin attached to the fingertip. A plastic nasal mask is inserted into the nostrils to ensure continuous oxygen intake during the procedure. Before the procedure, a spray is sprayed into the mouth and throat to numb the throat. This spray numbs the tongue, mouth and throat and makes the procedure easier to perform. Then a disposable plastic mouthpiece with a hole in the center is placed in the patient’s mouth between the front teeth through which the endoscopy tool will pass. Finally, the anesthesia team administers intravenous medication and the patient falls asleep after about 10 to 20 seconds.    ",
    "h2d4": "Once the anesthesia takes effect, the procedure begins. Gastroscopy is a procedure that takes about 5 minutes. During this procedure, the patient’s throat, esophagus, stomach and approximately the first 20-30 cm of the small intestine are examined. After the procedure is over, the endoscopy tool, nose mask and mouthpiece are removed. The patient is again taken to the rest room with his/her bed. Within a few minutes, the effect of the anesthesia drugs wears off and the patient begins to wake up. After about 15-20 minutes of rest in the resting room, the patient is expected to fully wake up and the intravenous line is removed and the patient is discharged when he/she feels well.    ",

    "h3": "After Gastroscopy Procedure    ",
    "h3d1": "After the gastroscopy, the effect of the anesthesia drugs wears off and the patient begins to recover. Pulse rate, blood oxygen level and blood pressure are checked. The patient is then informed about the procedure and discharged.    ",
    "h3d2": "The difficulty in swallowing caused by the effect of the spray sprayed to numb the throat before the procedure lasts for about 30-60 minutes after gastroscopy. For this reason, liquid and food consumption is started one hour after the procedure. In routine endoscopic procedures, a biopsy sample is taken from the stomach. For this reason, it is recommended to prefer light and soft foods and not to consume very hot foods and drinks on the first day after the procedure. In cases that may be more risky in terms of bleeding, such as removal of polyps or masses during the procedure, the liquid diet may be extended for a few more days. If there are any medications (especially blood thinners) that have been suspended due to gastroscopy, the patient will be informed about when they will be resumed.    ",
    "h3d3": "It is important not to drive for a few hours after the procedure due to anesthesia and not to do things that require attention. At the end of these few hours, the patient can return to his/her daily work on the same day.    ",

    "h4": "Risks Of Gastroscopy    ",
    "h4d1": "Gastroscopy is a very easy and comfortable procedure. Routine endoscopic procedures are very safe and the risk is very low, especially when performed by competent hands.    ",
    "h4d2": "Especially in cases where endoscopic intervention is required (such as polyp or mass removal, stent placement, expansion procedures), risks such as bleeding may rarely be encountered. Such unwanted events (complications) can be easily managed in procedures performed by competent people.    ",

    "h5": "Frequently Asked Questions About Gastroscopy    ",

    "h5c1": "Is it an Important Procedure for Early Diagnosis?",
    "h5d1": "Gastroscopy can be life-saving by providing early diagnosis and, in some cases, treatment. To give an example of this, both gastroscopy and colonoscopy screening are performed in people with anemia or iron deficiency or positive fecal occult blood test in the tests performed when the patient has no complaints yet. In these scans, early stage tumors and cancers are detected in a considerable number of people and can be treated endoscopically.    ",

    "h5c2": "In which cases is it applied?",
    "h5d21": "Gastroscopy is frequently performed for complaints such as pain, burning, souring, scraping sensation in the stomach, bad breath, bloating, indigestion, loss of appetite, burning in the chest, bitter water in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, feeling of food stuck in the throat or chest, anemia, vitamin deficiencies, nausea, vomiting, hoarseness. It is also performed for complaints such as blood coming from the mouth (it may be red or in the form of coffee grounds), blood coming from the rectum or black colored stools (it should be noted that black colored stools may be a sign of stomach bleeding), involuntary weight loss.    ",
    "h5d22": "In people with a family history of stomach cancer, gastroscopy should be performed for control purposes regardless of the complaint, and if a bacterium called helicobacter pylori is detected in the stomach, it should be treated appropriately.    ",

    "h5c3": "Who Cannot Have Gastroscopy?",
    "h5d3": "Gastroscopy should not be performed on people who have consumed liquid or solid food or drunk water in the last 8 hours. The incomplete emptying of the stomach poses a risk as it may cause stomach contents to escape into the throat and lungs during the procedure. Therefore, food and beverage consumption should be stopped at least 8 hours before the procedure. In addition, since the use of certain blood thinners may increase the risk of bleeding, gastroscopy should be planned with the knowledge of the relevant doctor. In addition, due to the risk of anesthesia in patients with serious heart and lung diseases, kidney and liver failure and in elderly patients, the procedure should be decided by the doctor and anesthesiologist together. Routine gastroscopic procedures should be avoided in pregnant women unless absolutely necessary.    ",

    "h5c4": "Is there any pain or gagging during the gastroscopy procedure?",
    "h5d4": "Since the procedure is performed under anesthesia, the patient does not feel any pain or gagging during the procedure. The patient does not even remember the procedure after the anesthesia wears off.    ",

    "h5c5": "Can People With Chronic Diseases Such As Heart, Cancer And Diabetes Have Gastroscopy?",
    "h5d5": "People with chronic diseases can also undergo gastroscopy; however, the medications used for anesthesia preparation must be checked by a doctor. In some cases, medication changes or dose changes may be required. For this reason, the person should discuss this situation with his/her doctor before the procedure.    ",

    "h5c6": "At what intervals can gastroscopy be performed?",
    "h5d6": "There is no routine time for repeat gastroscopy. Each patient and disease has a specific follow-up period. For example, gastritis or duodenal ulcers usually do not require a routine follow-up endoscopy, but gastric ulcers may require a follow-up gastroscopy after treatment (1-2 months). This is because of the rare risk of stomach cancers starting as stomach ulcers.    ",

    "h5c7": "Is Gastroscopy a Painful Procedure?",
    "h5d7": "Anesthesia is given during the procedure and there are no complaints such as pain, nausea, gagging or inability to breathe.    ",

    "h5c8": "Is a Patient Relative, Companion Required for the Procedure?",
    "h5d8": "It is not necessary to have a companion with the person undergoing the procedure; however, since anesthesia is given, no work requiring attention and no driving should be done for a few hours after the procedure. For this reason, it is recommended that the patient does not drive himself/herself to the procedure.",

    "h5c9": "When Can I Eat After Gastroscopy?",
    "h5d9": "If no intervention was performed during the procedure, food can usually be consumed one hour after the procedure. Biopsies are often taken during the gastroscopy procedure. Therefore, on the first day after the procedure, it is recommended to consume liquid foods such as soups; yogurt, pudding and puree-like soft and low-fat foods. If an intervention is performed during the procedure, the doctor will inform the patient about what needs to be done.    ",

    "h5c10": "If a biopsy was taken during the procedure, when is the pathology result known?",
    "h5d10": "Pathology results are usually available within 7-10 days.    ",

    "h5c11": "Does Gastroscopy Prevent Breastfeeding?",
    "h5d11": "The procedure itself does not prevent breastfeeding; however, due to the risk of the anesthesia drugs administered for the procedure passing into the milk, it is recommended to express milk for about 4-6 hours after gastroscopy and discard it before giving it to the baby. To prevent the baby from starving, the mother can express and store breast milk before the procedure and give it to her baby during the hours when she cannot breastfeed.    "
