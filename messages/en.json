    "h2d2": "On the day of the procedure, a consent form is signed in the endoscopy unit, the patient is registered and the patient is taken to the preparation room. In the preparation room, the patient is hospitalized and prepared for the procedure. The relevant nurse asks the patient whether he/she has a chronic disease, the medications he/she is taking, the last time he/she took which medication, the last time he/she ate and drank, and whether he/she has any allergies. The patient is then given anesthesia and taken to the procedure room with the patient bed.    ",
    "h2d3": "An endoscopy nurse, anesthesia team and gastroenterologist are present in the procedure room. Before the procedure begins, there is a preparation period of about 1-2 minutes. During this time, the patient’s blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oxygen level in the blood are measured with a small device like a clothespin attached to the fingertip. A plastic nasal mask is inserted into the nostrils to ensure continuous oxygen intake during the procedure. Before the procedure, a spray is sprayed into the mouth and throat to numb the throat. This spray numbs the tongue, mouth and throat and makes the procedure easier to perform. Then a disposable plastic mouthpiece with a hole in the center is placed in the patient’s mouth between the front teeth through which the endoscopy tool will pass. Finally, the anesthesia team administers intravenous medication and the patient falls asleep after about 10 to 20 seconds.    ",
    "h2d4": "Once the anesthesia takes effect, the procedure begins. Gastroscopy is a procedure that takes about 5 minutes. During this procedure, the patient’s throat, esophagus, stomach and approximately the first 20-30 cm of the small intestine are examined. After the procedure is over, the endoscopy tool, nose mask and mouthpiece are removed. The patient is again taken to the rest room with his/her bed. Within a few minutes, the effect of the anesthesia drugs wears off and the patient begins to wake up. After about 15-20 minutes of rest in the resting room, the patient is expected to fully wake up and the intravenous line is removed and the patient is discharged when he/she feels well.    ",

    "h3": "After Gastroscopy Procedure    ",
    "h3d1": "After the gastroscopy, the effect of the anesthesia drugs wears off and the patient begins to recover. Pulse rate, blood oxygen level and blood pressure are checked. The patient is then informed about the procedure and discharged.    ",
    "h3d2": "The difficulty in swallowing caused by the effect of the spray sprayed to numb the throat before the procedure lasts for about 30-60 minutes after gastroscopy. For this reason, liquid and food consumption is started one hour after the procedure. In routine endoscopic procedures, a biopsy sample is taken from the stomach. For this reason, it is recommended to prefer light and soft foods and not to consume very hot foods and drinks on the first day after the procedure. In cases that may be more risky in terms of bleeding, such as removal of polyps or masses during the procedure, the liquid diet may be extended for a few more days. If there are any medications (especially blood thinners) that have been suspended due to gastroscopy, the patient will be informed about when they will be resumed.    ",
    "h3d3": "It is important not to drive for a few hours after the procedure due to anesthesia and not to do things that require attention. At the end of these few hours, the patient can return to his/her daily work on the same day.    ",

    "h4": "Risks Of Gastroscopy    ",
    "h4d1": "Gastroscopy is a very easy and comfortable procedure. Routine endoscopic procedures are very safe and the risk is very low, especially when performed by competent hands.    ",
    "h4d2": "Especially in cases where endoscopic intervention is required (such as polyp or mass removal, stent placement, expansion procedures), risks such as bleeding may rarely be encountered. Such unwanted events (complications) can be easily managed in procedures performed by competent people.    ",

    "h5": "Frequently Asked Questions About Gastroscopy    ",

    "h5c1": "Is it an Important Procedure for Early Diagnosis?",
    "h5d1": "Gastroscopy can be life-saving by providing early diagnosis and, in some cases, treatment. To give an example of this, both gastroscopy and colonoscopy screening are performed in people with anemia or iron deficiency or positive fecal occult blood test in the tests performed when the patient has no complaints yet. In these scans, early stage tumors and cancers are detected in a considerable number of people and can be treated endoscopically.    ",

    "h5c2": "In which cases is it applied?",
    "h5d21": "Gastroscopy is frequently performed for complaints such as pain, burning, souring, scraping sensation in the stomach, bad breath, bloating, indigestion, loss of appetite, burning in the chest, bitter water in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, feeling of food stuck in the throat or chest, anemia, vitamin deficiencies, nausea, vomiting, hoarseness. It is also performed for complaints such as blood coming from the mouth (it may be red or in the form of coffee grounds), blood coming from the rectum or black colored stools (it should be noted that black colored stools may be a sign of stomach bleeding), involuntary weight loss.    ",
    "h5d22": "In people with a family history of stomach cancer, gastroscopy should be performed for control purposes regardless of the complaint, and if a bacterium called helicobacter pylori is detected in the stomach, it should be treated appropriately.    ",

    "h5c3": "Who Cannot Have Gastroscopy?",
    "h5d3": "Gastroscopy should not be performed on people who have consumed liquid or solid food or drunk water in the last 8 hours. The incomplete emptying of the stomach poses a risk as it may cause stomach contents to escape into the throat and lungs during the procedure. Therefore, food and beverage consumption should be stopped at least 8 hours before the procedure. In addition, since the use of certain blood thinners may increase the risk of bleeding, gastroscopy should be planned with the knowledge of the relevant doctor. In addition, due to the risk of anesthesia in patients with serious heart and lung diseases, kidney and liver failure and in elderly patients, the procedure should be decided by the doctor and anesthesiologist together. Routine gastroscopic procedures should be avoided in pregnant women unless absolutely necessary.    ",

    "h5c4": "Is there any pain or gagging during the gastroscopy procedure?",
    "h5d4": "Since the procedure is performed under anesthesia, the patient does not feel any pain or gagging during the procedure. The patient does not even remember the procedure after the anesthesia wears off.    ",

    "h5c5": "Can People With Chronic Diseases Such As Heart, Cancer And Diabetes Have Gastroscopy?",
    "h5d5": "People with chronic diseases can also undergo gastroscopy; however, the medications used for anesthesia preparation must be checked by a doctor. In some cases, medication changes or dose changes may be required. For this reason, the person should discuss this situation with his/her doctor before the procedure.    ",

    "h5c6": "At what intervals can gastroscopy be performed?",
    "h5d6": "There is no routine time for repeat gastroscopy. Each patient and disease has a specific follow-up period. For example, gastritis or duodenal ulcers usually do not require a routine follow-up endoscopy, but gastric ulcers may require a follow-up gastroscopy after treatment (1-2 months). This is because of the rare risk of stomach cancers starting as stomach ulcers.    ",

    "h5c7": "Is Gastroscopy a Painful Procedure?",
    "h5d7": "Anesthesia is given during the procedure and there are no complaints such as pain, nausea, gagging or inability to breathe.    ",

    "h5c8": "Is a Patient Relative, Companion Required for the Procedure?",
    "h5d8": "It is not necessary to have a companion with the person undergoing the procedure; however, since anesthesia is given, no work requiring attention and no driving should be done for a few hours after the procedure. For this reason, it is recommended that the patient does not drive himself/herself to the procedure.",

    "h5c9": "When Can I Eat After Gastroscopy?",
    "h5d9": "If no intervention was performed during the procedure, food can usually be consumed one hour after the procedure. Biopsies are often taken during the gastroscopy procedure. Therefore, on the first day after the procedure, it is recommended to consume liquid foods such as soups; yogurt, pudding and puree-like soft and low-fat foods. If an intervention is performed during the procedure, the doctor will inform the patient about what needs to be done.    ",

    "h5c10": "If a biopsy was taken during the procedure, when is the pathology result known?",
    "h5d10": "Pathology results are usually available within 7-10 days.    ",

    "h5c11": "Does Gastroscopy Prevent Breastfeeding?",
    "h5d11": "The procedure itself does not prevent breastfeeding; however, due to the risk of the anesthesia drugs administered for the procedure passing into the milk, it is recommended to express milk for about 4-6 hours after gastroscopy and discard it before giving it to the baby. To prevent the baby from starving, the mother can express and store breast milk before the procedure and give it to her baby during the hours when she cannot breastfeed.    "

    "h1d4": "Colonoscopy is a procedure that can be performed not only for diagnosis but also for treatment. One of the most common conditions encountered during this procedure is colon polyps, especially in people over the age of 40. During colonoscopy, it is possible not only to diagnose but also to treat these polyps. If colon polyps are detected, they are removed with different techniques depending on their type or size. In this way, both diagnosis and treatment are provided and the risk of progression of these polyps and possible colon cancer in the future is eliminated.    ",
    "h1d5": "During colonoscopy, rectal diseases such as hemorrhoids and fissures can also be treated. In addition, procedures such as diagnosis of rectal bleeding, stopping bleeding by intervening in bleeding lesions, removal of superficial tumors or early stage cancers (endoscopic mucosal resection-EMR or endoscopic submucosal dissection-ESD), dilatation of strictures in the large intestine (dilatation procedures) or stenting are also performed.

    "h2d1": "Colonoscopy is a procedure that everyone over the age of 45 should have and repeat every 5 years, whether or not they have any complaints. The aim is to screen for colon cancer, as colon cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the world. With colonoscopy, polyps (moles) that are precursors of cancer can be easily recognized and removed during the procedure. Thus, cancers that may develop from polyps can also be prevented. As you can see, colon cancer is actually a preventable disease. Colonoscopy may be recommended at an earlier age, especially for people with a family history of colon cancer. For example, if one person in the family is diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of 45, it is recommended that other family members start colonoscopy screening 10 years earlier, at the age of 35.    ",
    "h2d2": "For colonoscopy, the intestine must first be cleansed. Colonoscopy cannot be performed without this cleaning. In addition, since it is a procedure that requires anesthesia, the procedure should be performed after evaluating the risk of anesthesia in heart, kidney and lung patients. In case of blood thinners, the procedure should be performed after the necessary precautions are taken in consultation with the doctor. The procedure is also not appropriate in case of suspected intestinal obstruction. Pregnant women should not undergo the procedure unless it is absolutely necessary.    ",

    "h5": "Preparation Phase    ",
    "h5d1": "The day before the procedure, the patient is asked to have a small toast with cheese and tea for breakfast and then to drink only clear liquids throughout the day. Clear liquid means liquids without sediment. The criterion here is that the liquid placed in the glass should be clear enough to show the other side. For example; water, tea, lemonade, grain-free meat broth, grain-free chicken broth, filtered compote juice without pulp, apple juice, cherry juice can be consumed easily. However, the consumption of cloudy and pulpy liquids such as soup, peach juice, apricot juice or milk is not suitable as it may cause intestinal pollution.    ",
    "h5d2": "Another important part of the preparation for colonoscopy is diarrhea and bowel cleansing with medication. The drugs used for this have changed considerably in recent years. Today, the preferred preparation is an orange-flavored powder that is mixed in a glass of water and drunk. This powder is mixed in a glass of water and drunk at 14.00 hours, one day before the procedure. Then wait for about half an hour and drink plenty of water or clear liquids (about 2 liters in 4 hours) from 14.30. After the second dose at 20.00 p.m., you should drink 2 liters of water or clear liquids again after 20.30. On the morning of the procedure at home, the preparation process ends with a final enema through the anus, waiting for 15-20 minutes and then going to the toilet.    ",

Before the procedure, the person is dressed in a disposable shorts. Afterwards, an intravenous line is opened in the arm to administer anesthesia medication and the person is taken to the procedure room with his/her bed. There is an endoscopy nurse, anesthesia team and a doctor in the procedure room.    ",
    "h6d2": "There is a preparation process of about 1-2 minutes before the procedure. During this time, the person’s blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and oxygen level in the blood are measured with a small device like a clothespin attached to the fingertip. A plastic nasal mask is inserted into the nostrils, through which oxygen is continuously supplied during the procedure. Finally, the anesthesia team administers intravenous medication and the person falls asleep after about 10-20 seconds. A rectal examination is performed before the procedure. The anus is evaluated for hemorrhoids or cracks. After applying gel to the anus, the procedure is started. The procedure is performed with a flexible device with a light and camera at the end. During the procedure, approximately the last 20-30 cm of the large intestine and small intestine are examined. The presence of conditions such as polyps, masses, inflammation and stenosis in the intestines is checked. If polyps are detected, they are removed with different techniques depending on their size. After the procedure is finished, the colonoscopy instrument is removed from the anus and the procedure is terminated. The person is then taken to the rest room with his/her bed. Within a few minutes, the person starts to wake up as the effect of anesthesia drugs wears off. The person is kept in the rest room for about 15-20 minutes.

    "h7d2": "This procedure requires the same preparation as a routine colonoscopy. The images are then analyzed on a computer using a CT or MRI scanner. Although the procedure seems practical, it has some important disadvantages. The first of these is that lesions under 1 cm may be missed and mucosal surface changes cannot be evaluated clearly. Another important disadvantage is that if a suspicious lesion is seen during the procedure, a biopsy cannot be taken, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made and the lesion cannot be treated. If a suspicious lesion is detected, standard colonoscopy should be performed again with colonoscopy preparation and the lesion should be recognized, a biopsy should be taken or a lesion such as a polyp should be removed.

    "q1": "What is Colon Polyp? What happens if a polyp is detected during the procedure?",
    "a1": "A polyp is a type of mole. Polyps in the large intestine are important because colon cancers are often caused by the growth of polyps. Colon polyps are divided into polyps with and without cancer risk. Which of the polyps is at risk of cancer can only be determined by examining the removed fragment under a microscope, i.e. by pathology. Therefore, polyps seen during colonoscopy are removed with different techniques during the procedure, depending on the size and shape of the polyp. This also prevents future colon cancers.    ",

The important point here is that the patient’s medications should be regulated before the procedure, necessary precautions should be taken according to the disease and the patient should be carefully evaluated by both the gastroenterologist who will perform the procedure and the anesthesiologist.    ",
    "q4": "Is Anesthesia Applied in Colonoscopy?",

    "q6": "What to Consider in Preparation for Colonoscopy?",
    "a6": "The most common mistakes made in preparation for colonoscopy are not taking medications on time, not drinking enough water and consuming fluids with pulp. In order to ensure adequate bowel cleansing, water consumption should be high and fluids with pulp (such as tomato soup, lentil soup, apricot juice) that may cause fecal formation should not be consumed.",
    "q7": "Does Nausea Occur During Preparation for Colonoscopy, What Should I Do Against Nausea?",
    "a7": "With today’s preparation medications, nausea is no longer a common complaint. In case of nausea during preparation, fluid intake should be suspended for a while, but once the nausea subsides, the preparation should be resumed.    ",

    "a9": "After the routine colonoscopy procedure, the anesthesia drugs are allowed to wear off for about half an hour and then the patient is discharged after feeling well. It is requested not to drive or do anything that requires attention for a few hours after the procedure. Normal food intake can be started approximately 1 hour after the procedure. The person can return to daily work a few hours after the procedure.    ",
    "q10": "Does the Patient Have Gas Problems After Colonoscopy?",
    "a10": "The intestines are normally contracted and stuck together. During a colonoscopy, a small amount of air is introduced into the intestine so that the inside of the intestine can be evaluated. This opens the folds of this organ and allows diseases that may be present between the folds to be recognized without being missed. However, sometimes this air given during the procedure may cause gas and abdominal pain. At the end of the procedure, the patient does not experience such pains thanks to the withdrawal of this air. However, if there is a complaint of gas, the patient should walk slowly after the effect of the anesthesia drugs wears off, which will facilitate the removal of the gas from the body.    ",
    "q11": "Is There a Bleeding Problem After Colonoscopy? What Should Be Considered In This Case?",
    "a11": "No bleeding is expected after routine colonoscopy. However, bleeding may occur in rare cases such as removal of polyps or superficial tumors or biopsy. If there is minor bleeding, the patient is informed about this. If there is any other bleeding, this should be reported to the doctor immediately.    ",
    "q12": "Is Colonoscopy an Obstacle to Breastfeeding?",
    "a12": "Since anesthesia will be taken, it is recommended to express and discard breast milk for 4-6 hours after the procedure.    ",
    "q13": "In which cases should a doctor be consulted after colonoscopy?",
    "a13": "There may be some abdominal pain due to gas after the procedure. However, in cases such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, feeling of weakness, darkening in the eyes, feeling faint or blood coming from the rectum, you should definitely consult a doctor.    "

    "q2": "Is the procedure reversible?",
    "a2": "Within a few months after the procedure, the stomach can be restored by cutting the stitches in the stomach. However, even if the stitches are cut after this period, the stomach cannot return to its former state as the stitched parts will be stuck to each other.

    "q3": "What happens to the sewn parts?",
    "a3": "The tissues in the stomach that have been shrunk by suturing fuse over time and remain in the stomach as shrunken but living tissue. Thanks to the tissues sticking to each other, the stomach does not open and thus its volume does not expand. The sutured parts remain in the stomach and no part of the stomach is cut out. The fact that no part of the stomach is removed ensures that the stomach continues to make enough acid, unlike in surgeries, and prevents digestive complaints.

In addition to the fact that this index must be 30 and above for the procedure to be applied, another important point is that the person should not be able to lose weight despite at least 6 months of diet attempts and adequate physical activity. In summary, this procedure can be performed in people who are obese and cannot lose weight naturally.      ",

    "q5": "Can this procedure be performed in people who have had stomach reduction surgery before and gained weight again?",

In addition, if a correctable health problem such as gastritis and ulcer is detected, it is aimed to treat these problems in the period until the procedure. If there is no obstacle in the endoscopic examination, the day of the procedure is planned. An 8-hour fasting is sufficient before the procedure.

During this preparation, the patient’s diseases, any allergies and current medications are questioned. After the file is filled out and the signature of the person is obtained for consent for the procedure, an intravenous line is opened to administer anesthesia drugs. Then he/she is taken to the procedure room. In the meantime, the patient is monitored; as in all endoscopic procedures, blood pressure, oxygen level in the blood and heart rhythm are continuously monitored on monitors. The stomach is entered with the endoscopy device and the inside of the stomach is checked for the last time. The gastric balloon is then inserted.

This hospitalization is to ensure a more comfortable night after the procedure; because the person does not feel any complaints in the first hours after the balloon application; however, nausea, vomiting and non-severe cramp-like pain may start about 6 hours after the procedure. Although the severity of these complaints gradually decreases after the first day, they usually last up to 3 days. Especially in the evening and night of the balloon procedure, nausea and cramps are at their peak. Spending this period in the hospital and intravenous administration of serum, cramps and nausea medication makes the process more comfortable.

    "q2": "What are the Risks and Side Effects?    ",
    "a2": "The gastric balloon procedure, performed by experienced hands, is an extremely safe procedure and has no serious side effects. The most common side effects that may be related to the procedure are nausea, vomiting and cramps that start after the procedure and pass within a few days.    ",

    "q3": "Does a Gastric Balloon Burst?    ",
    "a3": "Contrary to popular belief, the risk of gastric balloon bursting is quite rare.    ",

    "q4": "How long does the gastric balloon stay in the stomach?    ",
    "a4": "There are gastric balloons that can stay in the stomach for 6 months and 12 months. We generally prefer 6-month gastric balloons. Staying in for more than 6 months has a low effect on weight loss. For this reason, we recommend removing the balloon at the end of 6 months.    ",

    "q5": "How to Remove a Gastric Balloon?",
    "a5": "The gastric balloon is removed in a 10-minute endoscopic procedure under anesthesia. The procedure is quite easy. The patient rests in a rest room until the anesthetic wears off (about 15-20 minutes) and is discharged after the anesthetic medication wears off. There is no need to stay in hospital for this procedure.    ",

    "q6": "When Does Weight Loss Start After the Procedure?    ",
    "a6": "The weight loss process starts immediately after the gastric balloon application and this process continues for about 6 months. ",

    "q7": "What Should Be Considered After the Procedure?    ",
    "a7": "A healthy lifestyle and diet are essential after all obesity procedures, including the gastric balloon procedure. Otherwise, it is very difficult to reach the desired weight. Therefore, it is very important to follow the diet recommended by the dietitian. In general, liquid nutrition is recommended for the first 5-7 days after gastric balloon application, soft and puree-style foods in the second week, and a gradual transition to normal foods in the 3rd week.

It is an endoscopic (non-surgical) method that we often apply in patients with swallowing difficulties due to the muscles at the lower end of the esophagus being too tight, which we call “achalasia”.

    "h1": "In Which Diseases Is POEM Procedure Applied?    ",
    "h1d1": "POEM procedure is often applied in achalasia. Achalasia is a condition in which the muscles at the junction of the esophagus and stomach are very tight and therefore food and even water cannot pass into the stomach. These patients usually present to us with complaints such as difficulty swallowing, a feeling of being stuck in the chest, regurgitation of food, waking up at night with a cough due to regurgitation of food, bad breath and weight loss. The disease can be seen not only in adults but also in children. Sometimes children can be brought to the hospital with recurrent lung infections due to food residues escaping into the lungs because they cannot fully express their difficulty in swallowing. Apart from achalasia, a similar application called “Z-POEM” is performed in a condition that causes pocketing in the esophagus called “Zenker’s Diverticulum”. In addition, in diseases called “gastroparesis” with gastric movement defects and difficulty in gastric emptying, applications that accelerate gastric emptying by applying incisions to the muscles in the gastric outlet hole called “G-POEM” are also performed.    ",

    "h2": "How Is Achalasia Diagnosed?    ",
    "h2d1": "Patients usually consult a doctor with dysphagia. In this case, the first step is endoscopic examination. During endoscopy, the first priority is to make sure that there is no tumor in the esophagus that may prevent swallowing. Apart from this, the specific finding of achalasia is that the area connecting the esophagus and stomach is narrow and the endoscopy tool is forced into the stomach. However, this can sometimes be overlooked in inexperienced hands and a normal endoscopy report may be given, which can lead to a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of patients, sometimes for years. In some cases, observation of food residues in the esophagus facilitates the diagnosis. Another important method used in the diagnosis is a medicated x-ray of the esophagus called “esophageal passage radiography”.    ",
    "h2d2": "Here, it is seen that the esophagus is enlarged and the lower end is narrowed in the shape of a bird’s beak, which allows the diagnosis to be made. Finally, the pressure of the esophagus is measured using a manometer. This method is used to determine both the diagnosis and the type of achalasia.    ",
    "h3": "How Is The POEM Process Implemented?    ",
    "h3d1": "POEM is an endoscopic procedure performed under anesthesia, lasting approximately 30 to 60 minutes. After the patient is asleep, the esophagus is accessed through the mouth with an endoscopy tool. An incision is made in the middle of the esophagus and the thin wall of the esophagus is entered. A tunnel is created downwards by applying millimetric incisions in the esophageal wall. On one side of this tunnel is the surface mucosa of the esophagus and on the other side are the esophageal muscles. After creating a tunnel down to the stomach, the muscles in the esophagus, especially in the area connecting the esophagus and the stomach, which are very tight and do not allow food to pass into the stomach, are endoscopically cut and loosened. Finally, the mouth of the tunnel at the entrance to the esophagus is closed with endoscopic sutures and the procedure is completed.    ",
    
    "h4": "What Is The Preparation Process Before The Procedure?    ",
    "h4d1": "Usually 2 nights of hospitalization is required for POEM procedure. After the anesthetic effect wears off on the day of the procedure, patients are taken to their rooms and intravenous fluid and antibiotic treatment is started. There may be nausea and chest pain after the procedure, but intravenous painkillers and anti-nausea medications are administered and patients’ complaints are tried to be controlled. The next day after the procedure, clear fluid intake is started in the morning. Patients are discharged on the second day of the procedure.    ",
    "h4d2": "What are the other methods of treating achalasia and how is POEM superior to these methods?    ",
    "h4d3": "Methods other than POEM in the treatment of achalasia can be summarized as surgery, balloon dilation and Botox application. Botox application is an application based on the logic of relaxing those muscles by injecting botox into the very tight muscles at the lower end of the esophagus. Although it is the least effective method compared to other methods, the effect of the application lasts for 3 to 5 months. Another endoscopic application is dilatation by endoscopically inserting a balloon into the tight area. In this method, the muscles at the lower end of the esophagus are torn with a balloon and an expansion is achieved in this area. The most important disadvantage of this method is that the procedure can sometimes lead to uncontrolled tears and sometimes perforation. For this reason, it must be performed in competent hands. Another important disadvantage of balloon dilatation is that the effect of the procedure is not permanent and usually needs to be repeated every few years.    ",

    "h4d6": "Achalasia was previously treated with surgery. During the surgery, the abdominal cavity was entered and the muscles at the lower end of the esophagus were cut. However, since this surgery would also cause reflux, a separate intervention for reflux was performed in the same session. Today, this surgery has been largely replaced by POEM, a non-surgical method. In this way, no surgery is performed, the abdominal cavity is not entered, and unwanted side effects such as infection and nerve incision that may occur during surgery are minimized. In addition, since the procedure is completed endoscopically, the hospital stay, food intake and recovery time are also very fast. Patients can start taking liquid food the day after the procedure. In addition, it is recognized as the most effective method today in terms of treatment success and the treatment offers a permanent result.    ",

    "h5d1": "POEM is a very safe and low-risk procedure if performed by an experienced gastroenterologist. One of the risks associated with the procedure is bleeding that may occur in the incision areas. These bleeding can usually be controlled with some endoscopic interventions during the procedure. Another risk is air accumulation in the abdominal and chest cavity due to the carbon dioxide gas used during the procedure. Another risk is the risk of infection and this risk can be controlled with antibiotic applications. Finally, leakage in the esophagus may occur; however, this risk is extremely rare. In the results of studies, it has been reported that the life risks of the procedure are very low in experienced hands.    "

    "h1d1":"ERCP is commonly used to unblock the bile duct and remove gallstones. Over time, stones or bile sludge in the gallbladder can separate from the gallbladder and pass into the bile duct, causing a blockage. This is a serious health problem and requires rapid intervention. Patients usually seek medical help with symptoms such as severe pain in the right upper abdomen, nausea, vomiting and jaundice. If the condition progresses over time and bile duct inflammation is added, a more serious condition called cholangitis occurs. In this case, patients often experience additional symptoms such as chills, chills and fever. Laboratory tests may show increased levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubins).    ",
    "h1d2":"ERCP is also performed for tumors that may cause bile duct obstruction (pancreatic head cancers, biliary tract cancers), repair of bile duct leaks during surgery, and expansion of bile duct stenosis with stents or balloons.    ",
    "h2":"ERCP Application And Advantages    ",
    "h2d1":"First of all, the reason for the procedure must be fully clarified. After the examination, the patient is diagnosed with the following examinations and imaging methods. The procedure is performed under anesthesia and therefore patients do not feel any pain during the procedure. Before the procedure, the patient is put to sleep by the anesthesiologist and then a special endoscopy tool (duodenoscope) is inserted through the mouth; then the small intestine (duodenum) is reached by passing through the esophagus and stomach respectively. There is a very small hole, the size of a pinhead, through which the bile duct and pancreatic ducts merge and flow into the intestine. Once this is found, the targeted bile duct or pancreatic duct is entered through this hole. X-rays are taken from time to time during the procedure to see which duct has been entered. The mouth of the bile duct is then enlarged through an endoscopic incision. The duct is then entered. If the procedure is for gallstones, a balloon is sent behind the gallstone and the balloon is inflated. The balloon is then withdrawn and the stone in the bile duct is dropped into the intestine. Thus, the bile duct is opened. If the procedure is performed to widen the bile duct or pancreatic duct stenosis, balloon widening or stenting can be applied to this area.    ",
    "h2d2":"The biggest advantage of ERCP is that a difficult procedure such as removing stones in the bile ducts and opening obstructions can be performed endoscopically. In this way, the patient can regain his/her health without the need for surgery or incision. In other words, the procedure is performed by entering through the mouth and the procedure is terminated.    ",
    "h3":"How Long Is The Hospital Stay?    ",
    "h3d1":"Some patients may have abdominal pain after the procedure. These patients are kept in the hospital overnight for follow-up and control. On the morning of the day after the procedure, blood tests and controls are performed and patients are discharged if no additional treatment is required.    ",
    "h4":"What Kind Of Preparation Process Should The Patient Undergo Before The Procedure?    ",
    "h4d1":"As in all endoscopic procedures, the patient must fast for at least 8 hours. In addition, some blood thinners should be discontinued in the days before the procedure. All these issues are evaluated on a patient-specific basis.    ",
    "h4d2":"ERCP is performed under general anesthesia with the anesthesiologist putting the patient to sleep. In this way, the patient does not feel any pain and does not remember the procedure.    ",
    "h5":"Why Is A Stent Inserted During ERCP?    ",
    "h5d1":"A stent is not placed in every patient during the procedure, but in some cases a stent may be placed. For example, in the presence of a gallstone that has fallen into the bile duct, even if this stone is removed, a stent can be inserted to eliminate the risk of a new stone falling into the duct during the period until the gallbladder surgery. In the presence of large stones in the gallbladder, stenting may also be used when the procedure cannot be completed in a single session. A stent can also be inserted to relieve the compression caused by tumors of the bile duct, liver or pancreatic head. Another reason is bile duct injuries that may occur during gallbladder and liver surgeries. In these cases, a stent can also be placed in the bile duct.    ",
    "h6":"Are There Risks Associated With The Procedure?    ",
    "h6d1":"The ERCP procedure is much more complicated than routine endoscopic procedures and the risks are higher than other procedures. Possible risks include bleeding, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) and intestinal perforation. Therefore, it is vital that ERCP is performed by an experienced doctor and in a well-equipped hospital.    ",
    "h7":"What Is The Process After The Procedure?    ",
    "h7d1":"After the ERCP procedure, the patient usually stays in the hospital overnight and is planned to be discharged the next day if no problems are detected in the tests performed. Since each patient’s diagnosis and the reason for the procedure is different, the hospitalization period may vary. Depending on the disease, antibiotic treatment is usually recommended after discharge. After the procedure, food intake with liquid and fat-free foods is started. In case of complaints such as severe abdominal pain, jaundice, darkening of urine color, a doctor should be consulted. The first follow-up visit after the procedure varies depending on the disease, but is usually scheduled for a few weeks later.    "

    "h2d2":"The procedure is no different from a normal endoscopic procedure. After intravenous medication is administered, the patient is put to sleep and while the patient is under anesthesia, a special endoscopy device with an ultrasound device at the end is inserted through the mouth or anus depending on the area to be examined. In oral procedures, the area to be examined from the esophagus, stomach or small intestine is determined and ultrasound examination is performed from this area. In this way, very clear images are obtained and a detailed examination is performed as the area to be examined is viewed from very close neighboring organs. The procedure can only be a diagnostic examination or evaluation, or if a suspicious mass is seen, a needle is sent through the endoscopy device to take a biopsy from the mass and the procedure is terminated.    ",
    "h2d3":"One of the most important advantages of EUS is that it provides very detailed imaging of the organs in the digestive system and also allows biopsies to be taken from suspicious masses in these organs. While surgery was previously required to take a biopsy from a mass in the pancreas, biopsy can now be easily performed with the EUS method without the need for surgery. It is also the most sensitive method for determining how deep a cancer in the digestive system has spread.

In pancreatic masses, biopsy procedures previously performed under CT (computed tomography) or by opening the abdomen have now been replaced by biopsy under EUS. After entering the stomach with a special endoscopy tool, the pancreas, which is located just behind the stomach, is evaluated very clearly with ultrasound examination through the stomach. If a suspicious mass is seen in the pancreas, it provides the opportunity to take a biopsy from the mass in the pancreas with the help of a thin needle sent through the stomach or to drain it if there is a cyst.

It is therefore vital that the physician performing the procedure is experienced in this area. In case of bleeding or severe pain after the procedure, a doctor should be consulted.    ",
    "q3":"What should the patient pay attention to after the procedure?    ",
    "a3":"If the EMR procedure was performed in the esophagus or stomach, it is generally recommended to consume liquid or liquid foods that day and to avoid very hot drinks. If larger lesions are removed, this liquid diet may be extended to several days. All detailed information and recommendations are given to the patient by the doctor.    "

    "header":"ESD (Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection)",
    "d1":"Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a technique for the removal of deep-seated lesions or lesions larger than 1 cm. It is generally used for the removal of large tumors with superficial invasion or deeply located lesions. With this method, the borders of the lesion are first identified and marked. Then a special substance is injected into the base of the lesion, inflating it and creating a cushion. Afterwards, an endoscope and special equipment are inserted between the lesion and normal tissue and the lesioned part is removed from the normal tissue by making a slow incision under the lesion. This usually leaves a large opening, which is closed using endoscopic sutures in some cases, depending on the lesion.",

    "d2":"Increasingly used to replace traditional Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) techniques, ESD allows many patients to be treated without the need for surgery. This method allows lesions to be removed in one piece, thus providing a more accurate histologic evaluation and helping patients to recover faster.    ",

    "h1":"How Is ESD Process Performed?    ",
    "h1d1":"During the ESD procedure, the perimeter of the lesion is first marked with an electrocautery (a device for cutting or burning tissue using electrical energy). Then, using an electrocautery or similar instrument, the perimeter of the lesion is cut and the mucosal layer is removed. The submucosal layer at the base of the lesion is inflated by injecting a special fluid, which separates the lesion from the healthy tissue. Finally, the lesion is completely removed from the submucosal layer.    ",

    "h2":"Who Is It Suitable For?    ",
    "h2d1":"ESD is generally preferred in the early stages of non-invasive gastrointestinal cancers (for example, gastric cancer or colorectal cancer) and larger benign lesions (for example, adenomatous polyps).    ",
    "h3":"What Are The Risks Of ESD Procedure?    ",

    "h3d1":"ESD is a procedure that has a risk of bleeding and perforation and must be performed by experienced hands. Although it is a method used especially in risky and difficult to remove lesions and involves various risks due to the fact that the procedure is performed by going deep into the tissue, many patients regain their health with this method without the need for surgery.    ",

    "h4":"Post Implementation Process    ",
    "h4d1":"Patients are usually discharged the same day after the procedure. However, for procedures performed on large and risky lesions, an overnight hospital stay may rarely be required for follow-up.    ",
    "h4d2":"What should be considered after the procedure?    ",
    "h4d3":"Especially in esophageal and gastric procedures, it is recommended not to take food by mouth for a while and to start taking food with a liquid diet. However, the transition to nutrition should be evaluated on the basis of each patient and the procedure performed. Information about follow-up and starting food intake after the procedure will be communicated to the patient by the doctor. In case of bleeding and severe pain after the procedure, it is absolutely necessary to consult a doctor.    ",
    "h4d4":"Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a breakthrough method in the treatment of non-invasive early stage gastrointestinal cancers and removal of large benign lesions. This technique provides more accurate histologic evaluations with faster recovery times and less risk of complications. However, ESD is complex to perform and should be performed by an experienced endoscopist. Therefore, if you are considering this type of procedure, it is important to consult with a gastroenterologist to determine the best option for you.    "
